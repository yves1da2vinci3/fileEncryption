what is cipher 
A cipher is a method of encoding or decoding information to keep it secret from unauthorized parties. 
It is a type of algorithm that transforms plaintext (unencrypted message) into ciphertext (encrypted message)
 by applying a set of rules or steps. Ciphers have been used for centuries to secure communications and 
 protect sensitive information.

There are many different types of ciphers, ranging from simple substitution ciphers that replace each 
letter of the alphabet with another letter, to complex cryptographic ciphers that use advanced mathematical 
techniques and encryption keys to scramble and unscramble data. Some common examples of 
ciphers include the Caesar cipher, Vigen√®re cipher, and RSA cipher.

what is aes cipher
AES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard, which is a widely used symmetric
 key encryption algorithm. It was developed in the late 1990s as a replacement for 
 the outdated Data Encryption Standard (DES) and is now considered one of the most secure encryption methods available.

AES uses a block cipher, which means it operates on fixed-size blocks of plaintext and generates
 an equal-sized block of ciphertext. The block size is typically 128 bits, and the key size can be 128, 
 192, or 256 bits. AES works by applying a
 series of mathematical transformations, including substitution, permutation, and XOR operations,
  to the plaintext and key to produce the ciphertext.

One of the advantages of AES is its speed and efficiency, making it suitable for use in a wide range of 
applications, including secure communication protocols, disk encryption, and electronic payment systems. 
AES is also considered highly secure, as it has withstood extensive cryptanalysis and has not been broken to date.

What is GCM 
Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) is a mode of operation for block ciphers like AES that provides 
authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD). GCM combines the counter mode of encryption with the Galois field multiplication, 
which allows it to provide both confidentiality and authentication in a single operation.

In GCM, a unique initialization vector (IV) is used for each message,
 which is combined with a counter to produce a keystream. This keystream is then XORed with 
 the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. The authentication tag is generated by calculating a hash 
 of the ciphertext and additional data using Galois field multiplication.

GCM is highly efficient and is widely used in applications that require secure communication
 over the internet, such as SSL/TLS, IPsec, and SSH. It is also used for disk encryption and 
 other applications that require authenticated encryption. GCM is considered secure and
  has been adopted as a standard by many organizations, including NIST and IEEE.
